## Module 1 challenge
The User Story or aim of this challenge is to improve accessibility to the website through coce refactoring. That is, modify the application's code without modifying the overall structure or function, but rather to enhance its functionality.
To achieve this, the author has implemented a few changes as follow;
The title of the page was changed to be more relevant i.e. Horiseon-your social media solutions, rather than just "website".
The website did not have alternative text function which would not be accessible for users with accessibility issues or using text reader functions.
The semantic HTML elements were checked and altered to avoid using redundant 'div' syntax.
According to the assignment's Technical Acceptance Criteria, CSS selectors can be consolidated to avoid 'Don't Repeat Yourself' codes.

## Learning Points
Through this learning experience, the author has learned to read codes and look for 
ways to enhance and simplify the code and to employ git workflow.
